# ORKGcsv v0.1a
This is a tool for R that prepares a CSV spreadsheet to upload data to the [Open Research Knowledge Graph](https://orkg.org/) (ORKG). It uses rShiny to gather metadata on papers by DOI. The script is designed to work with the [Restoration Ecology - Intervention Study](https://orkg.org/template/R670159) template for semantic annotation. The included CSV files restrict entry fields to make data entry more consistent and easier.

There are lots of to-dos for this particular script:
- [ ] Make the fields reset after saving entries to the data table.
- [ ] Suggest IUCN EFG based on the coordinates (Tim working on this)
- [ ] Make the code a bit prettier/add comments/etc.

- [X] Suggest city, province and country based on coordinates
